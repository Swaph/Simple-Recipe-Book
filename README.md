# Simple-Recipe-Book
This is a web application that allows users to add, search, and delete recipes. I built this project to practice basic front-end skills and to learn how to build an interface using core web standards. This project uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
